# nssssh - Not So Secure Simple SHell
The nssssh, like the name says, is gonna be a shell easy to manipulate but with probably lot of vulnerabilities because I'm not PDA.

## Download ?
You can download the source code and play with it but there is no interface, or stable and working shell for now.

## Authors and acknowledgment
I'm currently the only one working on that project (tubo), but I have to say a big thanks to PDA for his Posix manual and the System Programming courses.

## License
I'll add a license when there'll be more things in that repo (but it's probably gonna be a `GNU GPLv3` license)

## Project status
Just started !
